      <H3>1. Visit the Services Page</H3>
      <p className="mb-0">
        The first step is ingesting the metadata from your sources. Under
        Settings, you will find a Services link an external source system to
        OpenMetadata. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure
        metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.
      </p>
      <p>To visit the Services page, select Services from the Settings menu.</p>

      />

      <H3>2. Create a New Service</H3>
      <p>Click on the Add New Service button to start the Service creation.</p>

      <H3>3. Select the Service Type</H3>
      <p>Select {connector} as the service type and click Next.</p>

      <H3>4. Name and Describe your Service</H3>
      <p>
        Provide a name and description for your service as illustrated below.
      </p>
      <h4 className="mt-4">Service Name</h4>
      <p>
        OpenMetadata uniquely identifies services by their Service Name. Provide
        a name that distinguishes your deployment from other services, including
        the other {connector} services that you might be ingesting metadata
        from.

      <p>
        In this step, we will configure the connection settings required for
        this connector. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that
        you've configured the connector to read from your {connector} service as
        desired.
