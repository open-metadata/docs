# Troubleshooting

## Consumer and schema registry config

When configuring the Kafka connector, we could need to pass extra parameters to the consumer or the schema registry to 
be able to connect. The accepted values for the consumer can be found in the following 
[link](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md), while the ones optional for 
the schema registry are [here](https://docs.confluent.io/5.5.1/clients/confluent-kafka-python/index.html#confluent_kafka.schema_registry.SchemaRegistryClient).

The image below shows what the configuration of a local Kafka server with a secured schema registry would look like:
