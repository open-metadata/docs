# Upgrade from 0.12 to 0.13

Upgrading from 0.12 to 0.13 can be done directly on your instances. This page will list few general details you should take into consideration when running the upgrade.


## Highlights

### Deprecating botPrincipals from OpenMetadata Configuration

Starting with `0.13.0`, we have deprecated the initial configurations for Authorizer Bot Pincipals. This means that all the configs will be taken care from UI once it's up and running under settings >> bots section. The default once available and enabled will be `ingestion-bot` which will have JWT Token configured. You can edit the same for configuring service principals instead of using the default JWT Auth mechanism. For more information on configuring Bots, you can visit [Enable Security](/deployment/security).
