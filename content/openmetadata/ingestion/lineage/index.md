# Lineage Ingestion

A large subset of connectors distributed with OpenMetadata include support for lineage ingestion. Lineage ingestion processes queries to determine upstream and downstream entities for data assets. Lineage is published to the OpenMetadata catalog when metadata is ingested.

Using the OpenMetadata user interface and API, you may trace the path of data across tables, pipelines, and dashboards.
